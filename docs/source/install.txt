Pre-built installation
----------------------

On systems that support setuptools, the package can be installed from the
`Python packaging index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-fuzzy>`__ using


::

  easy_install -U scikit-fuzzy

or

::

  pip install -U scikit-fuzzy

Installation from source
------------------------

Obtain the source from the git-repository at
`http://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy
<http://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy>`_ by running::

  git clone http://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy.git

in a terminal (you will need to have git installed on your machine).

If you do not have git installed, you can also download a zipball from
`https://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy/zipball/master
<https://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy/zipball/master>`_.

The SciKit can be installed globally using::

  pip install -e .

or locally using::

  python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}

If you prefer, you can use it without installing, by simply adding
this path to your ``PYTHONPATH`` variable.
